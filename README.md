# IsotopeTableDF.jl

This package exports the `DataFrame` called `isotopes_df`, which stores the information about the isotopes.
The data is the same as in [IsotopeTable.jl](https://github.com/Gregstrq/IsotopeTable.jl). The dataframe is pulled from [this repo](https://github.com/Gregstrq/Isotope-data).
